# SVG Optimizer

Fork of https://github.com/svg/svgo

## Why?

SVG files, especially those exported from various editors, usually
contain a lot of redundant and useless information. This can include
editor metadata, comments, hidden elements, default or non-optimal
values and other stuff that can be safely removed or converted without
affecting the SVG rendering result.
